## _PROBLEM STATEMENT_

OUR AIM IS TO SCAN THROUGH A WEB PAGE AND DETECT WHAT BODIES OF
TEXT PROMOTE HATE OR CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS HATE SPEECH. USERS CAN
INSERT A WEBSITE LINK INTO OUR WEB APPLICATION AND IT WILL SCRAPE
TEXTUAL CONTENT ON THE WEB PAGE AND ON IMAGES WHILE CLASSIFYING
WHETHER THE CONTENT PROMOTES HATE SPEECH OR NOT AND PROVIDE A
DETAILED STATISTIC.

## _APPROACH_

- GATHERING DATASETS FROM THE INTERNET
- CREATE A NLP-MODEL THAT IDENTIFIES HATE SPEECH FROM TEXT AND IMAGES THROUGH OCR 
- MAKE A WEB SCRAPING SCRIPT
- INTEGRATE THE MODEL AND THE WEB SCRAPER INTO AN APPLICATION
- CREATE A UI THAT DISPLAYS HIGHLIGHTED HATE SPEECH FROM THAT PAGE
