## _PROBLEM STATEMENT_

OUR AIM IS TO SCAN THROUGH A WEB PAGE/A CSV FILE/AN AUDIO FILE/AN IMAGE FILE
AND DETECT WHAT BODIES OF TEXT PROMOTE HATE OR CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS HATE SPEECH. 
USERS CAN EITHER INSERT A WEBSITE LINK OR UPLOAD A FILE INTO OUR WEB APPLICATION 
AND IT WILL SCRAPE TEXTUAL CONTENT ON THE WEB PAGE AND ON IMAGES 
WHILE CLASSIFYING WHETHER THE CONTENT PROMOTES HATE SPEECH OR NOT AND PROVIDE A
DETAILED STATISTIC.

## _APPROACH_

- GATHERING DATASETS FROM THE INTERNET
- CREATE A NLP-MODEL THAT IDENTIFIES HATE SPEECH FROM TEXT, AUDIO AND IMAGES THROUGH OCR 
- MAKE A WEB SCRAPING SCRIPT FOR URL INPUTS
- INTEGRATE THE MODEL AND THE WEB SCRAPER INTO AN APPLICATION
- CREATE A UI THAT DISPLAYS SUMMARY OF HATE SPEECH PRESENT
